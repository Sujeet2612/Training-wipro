Assignment 3: Function Design and Modularization - Create a document that describes the design of two modular functions: one that returns the factorial of a number, and another that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. Include pseudocode and a brief explanation of how modularity in programming helps with code reuse and organization

Factorial:

start
input=number
fact=1
for(i=1;i<=number;i++)
fact=fact*i;
end

Fibonacci:

start
n1=1
n2=2
n=3
for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
n3=n1+n2
n1=n2
n2=n3

end
